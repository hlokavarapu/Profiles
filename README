Here are the profile config files necessary to install ASPECT through hashDist

To install hashDist run the following command outside of the directory Profiles:
  sh hashDistOnly.sh 

This requires git as well as python which come out of the box these days.

In the directory Profiles execute the command:
  git clone https://github.com/hashdist/hashstack.git

Lastly, to install Aspect execute the command:
  hit build -k always aspect.yaml

Likewise, to install Calypso execute the command:
  hit build -k always calypso.yaml

Also, if a .bashrc file doesn't exist in the home directory as in Ymir, then the utility hit won't be added to the path. So, hit should be in the install_Directory/hashdist/bin/hit. 

Note that this is currently a work-around. Once successfully built, the executable, aspect will be in ${HOME}/.hashdist/tmp/aspect-<hash>/_build 

The cookbooks and the like will be in ${HOME}/.hashdist/tmp/aspect-<hash>
