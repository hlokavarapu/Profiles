Here are the profile config files necessary to install ASPECT through hashDist

To install hashDist run the following command outside of the directory Profiles:
  sh hashDistOnly.sh 

In the directory Profiles execute the command:
  git clone https://github.com/hashdist/hashstack.git

Lastly, to install Aspect execute the command:
  hit build -k always aspect.yaml

Likewise, to install Calypso execute the command:
  hit build -k always calypso.yaml

Note that this is currently a work-around. Once successfully built, the executable, aspect will be in ${HOME}/.hashdist/tmp/aspect-<hash>/_build
